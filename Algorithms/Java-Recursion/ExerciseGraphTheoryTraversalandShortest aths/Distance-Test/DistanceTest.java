// We are given a directed graph. We are given also a set of pairs of vertices. Find the shortest distance between each
// pair of vertices or -1 if there is no path connecting them.
// On the first line, you will get N, the number of vertices in the graph. On the second line, you will get P, the number
// of pairs between which to find the shortest distance.
// On the next N lines will be the edges of the graph and on the next P lines, the pairs.
