// Write a program that prints all of the possible distributions of a group of friends in a cinema hall. On the first line
// you will be given all of the friend&#39;s names separated by comma and space. Until you receive the command
// &quot;generate&quot; you will be given some of those friend&#39;s names and a number of the place that they want to have.
// (format: &quot;{name} - {place}&quot;) So here comes the tricky part. Those friend&#39;s want only to sit on the place that
// they have chosen. They cannot sit on other places. For more clarification see the examples below.
// Output
// Print all the possible ways to distribute the friends having in mind that some of them want a particular place and
// they will sit there only. The order of the output does not matter.
// Constrains
// ï‚· The friends names and the number of the place will always be valid
